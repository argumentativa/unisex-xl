# Cheatsheets
## Quick Reference - Scan & Glance

This folder contains distilled, scannable reference materials optimized for live coding sessions. Print these. Keep them visible while coding.

## Available Cheatsheets

### 🎓 [beginner.md](./beginner.md)
**For: Learning by doing**
- Copy-paste ready code blocks
- Foundational Tone.js & Strudel syntax
- Progressive from simple to complex
- Every block makes sound immediately
- 800+ lines of practical examples

**When to use:**
- First time using Tone.js or Strudel
- Learning JavaScript syntax through audio
- Want to paste → hear → modify → learn
- Building muscle memory for patterns

---

### 🎚️ [mixing.md](./mixing.md)
**For: Sound quality & balance**
- Frequency map (20Hz-20kHz)
- Filter frequencies by instrument
- Gain levels (relative volumes)
- Compression quick guide
- Effects amounts (reverb, delay, distortion)
- Panning rules
- Emergency fixes

**When to use:**
- Mix sounds muddy or harsh
- Unsure which frequencies to cut/boost
- Need compression ratio for bass/drums
- Balancing instrument volumes
- Quick parameter lookup during coding

## How to Use These Cheatsheets

### During Live Coding:
```
1. Open cheatsheet in browser or markdown viewer
2. Keep visible in second monitor or split screen
3. Glance for quick parameter values
4. Copy-paste code blocks as needed
5. Modify to fit your pattern
```

### For Learning:
```
1. Read top to bottom once
2. Try every code example
3. Modify one parameter at a time
4. Listen to the difference
5. Return to reference when stuck
```

### For Quick Lookups:
```
Need filter frequency? → mixing.md, line 21-31
Need code template? → beginner.md, Part 9
Forgot synth syntax? → beginner.md, Part 1
Mix sounds harsh? → mixing.md, line 160
```

## Cheatsheet Philosophy

**1-Page Rule:** Each cheatsheet should be scannable in under 30 seconds

**Copy-Paste First:** Code blocks work immediately without modification

**No Fluff:** Only essential information, no explanations unless critical

**Organized by Use:** Group by what you're trying to do, not theory

**Print-Friendly:** Markdown renders cleanly, tables use ASCII

### Full Documentation
- **Detailed guides:** `docs/books/`
- **Framework docs:** `docs/reference/`
- **Working patterns:** `/patterns/`

### From Cheatsheet to Deep Dive
- Start: Cheatsheet (quick reference)
- Next: `docs/reference/` (framework guides)
- Then: `docs/books/` (production techniques)
- Finally: Create your own patterns in `/patterns/`

## Adding New Cheatsheets

**Criteria for inclusion:**
- Must be 1-2 pages max
- Must be scannable (tables, lists, code blocks)
- Must serve a specific use case
- Must be reference, not tutorial

**Suggested future cheatsheets:**
- `drums.md` - Kick/snare/hat patterns & synthesis
- `bass.md` - Bassline patterns & frequencies
- `scales.md` - Note names, scales, chord progressions
- `tonejs.md` - Tone.js API quick reference
- `strudel.md` - Strudel mini-notation quick reference
- `effects.md` - Effect chains & parameter ranges

**Naming convention:**
- Single word, lowercase: `mixing.md`, `beginner.md`, `drums.md`
- Descriptive: Name should indicate use case
- No prefixes: Not `cheatsheet-mixing.md`, just `mixing.md`

## Print Recommendations

**Best format:** Print to PDF from markdown viewer with syntax highlighting

**Recommended settings:**
- Paper: Letter or A4
- Margins: 0.5" all sides
- Font: Monospace (Courier, Monaco, Consolas)
- Size: 9-10pt for readability
- Include: File name in header

**Physical workflow:**
- Print all cheatsheets
- Keep in folder next to keyboard
- Flip through during sessions
- Annotate with pen as you learn

## How to Use

### Choose Your Framework:
- **Learning synthesis?** → Start with `tonejs.md`
- **Pattern-based workflow?** → Start with `strudel.md`
- **Need quick values?** → Use `quick-ref.md`

### Recommended Path:
```
1. Read relevant chapter in Dance Music Manual
   ↓
2. Open appropriate implementation (Tone.js or Strudel)
   ↓
3. Try examples in UNISEX XL
   ↓
4. Modify for your track
   ↓
5. Reference quick-ref.md for parameter tweaking

## Snoman's Core Principles

**"The three pillars of electronic music production:"**
1. **Rhythm** - The foundation
2. **Melody** - The hook
3. **Texture** - The atmosphere

**"Always consider:**
- What frequency range does this occupy?
- How does it interact with other elements?
- What is its role in the mix?"
